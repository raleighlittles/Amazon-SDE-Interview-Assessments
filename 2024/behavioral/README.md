# About

This is the "behavioral"/culture-fit section of the assessment. It does not contain any technical questions.

For this section, there are 2 statements provided, and you basically have to choose which of the two statements you fit the most in. Each statement has 2 options associated with it:

1) Most like me

2) More like me

For example:

>
> "I do not think pineapple belongs on pizza"          <----------->             "I think any food that is good on its own would make a good pizza topping"
>
>      (Most like me)                   (More like me)     <----------->        (More like me)                              (Most like me)


Keeping this in mind, below are the statement lists.
