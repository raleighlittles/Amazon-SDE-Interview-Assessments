# About

The assessment for this year was administered through the HackerRank platform.
This platform comes with a "Sample" test, basically just to get you familiarized with the process of how to submit/enter questions.

The first question was a Subjective question, with a free-write/text-box type answer.

The second question was an actual programming question. The question was [Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#Programming).
You're required to complete this question in the same language that your assessment is administered in, e.g. if you're interviewing for a Web position,
you'll have to fill it in Javascript, C/C++ for embedded, etc.
