# About

This project contains three Amazon software development engineer technical interview/assessments. The first was completed in 2019, administered via AMCAT, and the second was in 2021, the third in 2024 -- the last two were both administered via HackerRank.

Each assessment folder contains questions, sample test cases, and of course, annotated solutions to each question.
