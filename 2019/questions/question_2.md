# About 

Amazon Prime Air is developing a system that divides shipping routes using flight optimization routing systems to a cluster of aircraft that can fulfill these routes. Each shipping route is identified by a unique identifier and requires a fixed non-zero amount of travel distance between airports, and is defined to be either a 'forward' or a 'backward' route. Identifiers are guaranteed to be unique within their own route type, but not across route types.

Each aircraft should be assigned two shipping routes at once: one forward route and one return route. Due to the complex scheduling of flight plans, all aircraft have a fixed maximum operating travel distance, and cannot be scheduled to a fly a route that exceeds this maximum distance. The goal of the system is to optimize the total operating travel distance of a given aircraft. A forward/return shipping route pair is considered to be "optimal" if there does not exist another pair that has a higher operating travel distance than this pair, and also has a total less than or equal to the maximum safe travel distance of the aircraft.

For example, if the aircraft has a maximum operating travel distance of 3,000 miles, a forward return shipping route pair using a total of 2998 miles would be optimal if there does not exist a pair that uses a total operating distance of 2999 miles -- but would not be optimal if such a pair did in fact exist.

Your task is to write an algorithm to optimize the sets of forward/return shipping route pairs that allow the aircraft to be optimally utilized, given a list of forward shipping routes and a list of return shipping routes.en airports

# Input 

The input to the function/method consists of three arguments:
*maxTravelDist*, an integer representing the maximum operating travel distance of the given aircraft;
*forwardRouteList*, a list of pairs of integers where the first integer represents the unique identifier of a forward shipping route and the second integer represents the amount of travel distance of required by this shipping route.
*returnRouteList*, a list of pairs of integers where the first integer represents the unique identifier of a return shipping route and the second integer represents the amount of travel distance required by this shipping route.

# Output

Return a list of integers representing the pairs of IDs of forward and return shipping routes that optimally utilize the given aircraft. If no route is possible, return a list with empty pair.
